My Personal Website hosted by Github. 

Goal was to make a website which I believed was **BEAUTIFUL**, **FUNCTIONAL** and it allowed to me to **DISPLAY** my work.

Using technologies such as :
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
  
  
Plans for future iterations:
  - Convert the page into Single Page Design with Parallax Scrolling
  - Make the page Responsive
  - Explore using SASS
  - Explore using a CSS Framework such as Bulma
